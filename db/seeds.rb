# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Post.create(title: "First Post", subline: "a first post", body: "this is my first post in my website")

# Post.create(title: "Second Post", subline: "a second post", body: "this is my second post in my website")

# Link.create(title: "github", link: "https://github.com/bethpcassidy")
